# Assignment #2 - Programming with predicates
## Discrete Mathematics

by Rasmus Friis


# 1 PROgramming in LOGic
Create a program i Prolog.
You can either invent your own problem to solve or use one of the ideas
described below. The program should include facts and rules. Also a set of
meaningful questions to the program should be presented.
Please push to github and supply a README.md file.

Student calendar
Create a program that models students, classes, rooms, dates, and their relations.

# Mind map

Note that relations between subjects can be cyclic.
